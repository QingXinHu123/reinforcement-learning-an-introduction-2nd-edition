# reinforcement-learning-an-introduction-2nd-edition

Python replication for Sutton & Barto's book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html

When I read this book, at the same time, I will check the original code from [ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction) and correct some possible errors.
